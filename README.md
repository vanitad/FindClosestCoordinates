This sample application is created to find closest Coordinates based on User Input.

Since this application is making AJAX call to download the .json file it has to be run using any HTTP Server. Opening file directly from filesystem will not work.

I like to use npm module http-server.

Following are instructions to run this app.

sudo npm install -g http-server
cd to app directory 
http-server


Open in browser
http://localhost:8080/coordinates.html
